"""this is John from prepworks and I'm going to be going over everything you need to know for unit one which is the largest unit of AP Calculus AB B and BC
0:09
this section discusses limits and continuity both of which are key to understanding later units on the AP exam
0:15
mcqs will be about 10 to 12% limits for the ab and 4 to 7% of those of you who
0:21
are in BC now we're going to go over these 16 Topics in pretty deep detail but if you want a full study guide
0:28
that's 100% free of Char make sure to check out the link in our description and in the pinned comment for more now
0:35
let's get started remember that each of these topics is modeled on the college board's course and exam
0:41
description topic 1.1 introduces calculus and it introduces the concept
Topic 1.1 - Introducing Calculus: Can Change Occur at an Instant?
0:46
of a limit which is what we'll continue to explore throughout this unit calculus is the study of change it models Dynamic
0:54
change using a tool known as limit and we're going to get into that but first we need to present some simple Concepts
1:02
so you may recall from algebra that to find the value the Y value of any
1:08
function at a given point x say this one we could simply plug in the x value and then we would get a yvalue so if we
1:15
wanted to find what y was equal to when X is equal to 5 we would simply do y =
1:20
5^2 which is 25 we could also just look at a graph and see that it was in fact
1:27
25 but in calculus the limit changes that we do not want to
1:33
find what the value is at five we want to find what the value is infinitely close to five so for example the limit
1:42
as we approach xals 4 for this function is
1:48
equal to 16 okay how do I know that how do I know
1:54
that well as we see from this table as we get closer and closer to the x value
2:00
four which would go right here we get closer and closer to the value 16 we go
2:05
from 15.2 to 15.9 we go from 16.8 to 16.08 right we're getting closer and
2:12
closer to this value 16 and if we continue to extend this table to something like 3.99
2:18
999999999 and infinitely kept going we would get closer and closer to the value of 16 okay well it does not matter for
2:25
calculus what that value truly is if we're trying to find the limit okay now the other thing that college
2:31
board wants you to know for this topic is that the average rate of change is undefined when the change in the
2:37
independent variable is zero and the change in the dependent variable is non zero so essentially that's a straight
2:42
line here there's a non there is a undefined rate of change with a vertical line
2:50
there's an undefined rate of change and that's all you need to know for topic 1.1 topic 1.2 discusses defining limits
Topic 1.2 - Defining Limits and Using Limit Notation
2:57
and using limit notation topic 1.2 is very simple it shows this common
3:02
notation that all limits have let's break this down this is the limit operator it's simply L IIM usually we
3:11
use a cursive L to indicate that it's not a one then we have a function here this is the function that we are finding
3:17
the limit of at a point and that point is
3:23
C so if I want to define the limit of a function let's say f ofx = x Cub it
3:29
would be written as a limit of x cubed as X approaches let's say I want to find the limit at xal 4 4 this would be equal
3:37
to some real number hence R we're going to get into how you would find that
3:43
limit in future topics another thing to note is that the Epsilon Delta definition is specifically
3:50
not assessed by the college board if you learn this in your Calculus AB or Calculus BC class you can ignore it for
3:56
the purposes of the AP exam however on a unitest it might be assessed if your teacher taught it in
4:03
class topic 1.3 estimating limit values from graphs is one of the biggest topics in all of AP Calculus AB or BC there's a
Topic 1.3 - Estimating Limit Values from Graphs
4:11
lot to break down here so let's get into our first bit here we've got one-sided limits one-sided limits evaluate a limit
4:18
as we approach only from One Direction previously we introduced a limit as something like this where we have a
4:25
function and we want to evaluate from both sides right we evalate from from both sides at some point let's call this
4:32
C okay and our value here whatever value that we get as we get closer and closer is the limit at C right and we wrote
4:40
that as limb X approach c f ofx is equal to r or equal to l or
4:47
some real number right the one-sided limit is different
4:53
it only evaluates from One Direction This is especially helpful for when we have a peie wise function or something
4:59
where when we approach a value C we get a different direction if we approach from the right from than from the left
5:05
and that full limit that we discussed earlier the liim as X approaches C that only exists
5:12
if the one-sided limits are equal now let's take a look at this graph here as we approach from the left we see we get
5:19
some value that's called as a but as we approach from the right we get a value B
5:24
at the same point c as we get infinitely close to C now notice I have a little circle here I can make that a little bit
5:30
more clear I have a little circle right here okay that means that the function is not defined at that point but it is
5:36
defined as at every Point as we get infinitely closer from this direction right and we don't care about what C is
5:42
actually equal to because remember in a limit we want to know what the point what the value is as we get infinitely
5:47
close not the value actually at that point okay now we see here we're coming
5:52
from both directions we're getting different answers these are one-sided limits this is our one-sided limit from
6:00
the left this is our one-sided limit from the right and how do we notate that well of course we have another rule so
6:06
as we evalue from the left we add a little minus sign right after the C and as we evaluate from the right we add a
6:11
little plus sign I like to remember this as a pair of axes if we have an x- axis
6:17
then this is the negative side and this is the positive side and that makes sense because this is on the left and
6:22
this is on the right it's the same way for
6:27
this okay let's take a look at example here if we're trying to find this is the right side remember because we have a
6:33
plus we're approaching from the right side what do we get well as we approach Zer from the right side we get -6 our
6:39
limit is equal to -6 as we approach from the left side we get the same thing also
6:45
-6 so what can we say about this function at X approaches zero right the limit as X approaches Z here is clearly
6:53
-6 because it is the same from both the right and the left so we can say that
6:58
the limit as X approaches zero with no plus or minus after it of f
7:03
ofx is equal to -6 because these are the same that's another rule the limit only
7:10
exists the full limit right only exists at C when the one-sided limits are equal so in this case the one-sided limit as C
7:17
does not exist right it does not exist because this way this one-sided limit is not equal to this one-sided limit now we
7:24
can use graphs as we just did but we do have to be cautious it's possible for example that if I did did not know that
7:30
this function was FX = 4x - 6 right that there could be some sort of complicated algebra here and there was a little jump
7:36
right here and I wouldn't know because my graph window is different so caution must always be used when we're using a
7:42
graph now let's also take another look at something that's a little bit different that we can see from a graph a
7:48
limit fails to exist when we have a jump discontinuity a vertical asmp toote or a domain with oscillating Behavior where
7:55
the period of oscillation approaches Infinity oscillating behavior is also observed something like you know s of X
8:01
and we can see if we try to find the limit at whatever this point is here we would be able to find that limit right
8:07
now let's take a look at that we're going to get more into depth with that in a second but first let's take a look at a vertical ASM toote here we can
8:13
clearly see we have a vertical ASM toote at X approaches zero from both sides right this side doesn't exist DN is what
8:19
we write when it doesn't exist and this side doesn't exist right we approach from the right it approaches a Asm toote
8:26
we approaching the left it also approaches an ASM toote so that doesn't exist the full limit doesn't exist
8:32
either also DN e let's take a look at that oscillating Behavior I mentioned
8:38
earlier this is not even oscillating Behavior this is as we approach zero the
8:43
oscillating Behavior the period of that oscillating Behavior approaches Infinity unlike something normal like sine of x
8:49
where it's pretty constant right it is constant right from here we see that we can't really figure out where it's going
8:56
right here right it could it's anywhere between one and negative 1 it could be anything right so this doesn't exist
9:02
either right and this also doesn't exist from both sides whichever way we approach this function as we get to zero
9:08
we can't tell what this limit is right take a look at another example right
9:14
here okay this is very hard to see right you
9:19
might think that both of these approach zero right you might think if this approaches zero from this side
9:25
approaches zero from this side but but when we zoom in we see this is not the case and this shows another Pitfall of
9:31
using a graph right we have an expanded window where the scale on our xaxis here is 50 or on our Y axis is 50 it's huge
9:38
right but when we change that scale to 0. five we can see that as we approach from the right direction we get one and
9:43
as we approach from the negative direction we get negative one when we approach to the left we get negative one
9:49
when we approach to the right we get positive one therefore we can also say for this one that the limit of the full
9:54
function of as X approach to Zero D NE e right mixure does not exist right
10:01
because when we approach Zero from different sides the one-sided limits are not equal one is not equal
10:07
toga1 so there is no limit that exists here topic 1.4 estimating limit values
Topic 1.4 - Estimating Limit Values from Tables
10:14
from tables now if we're given a question where we simply are given a function let's say like X cubed the best
10:20
way to solve this is through algebraic manipulation discuss in topics 1.5 and 1.6 or by using a graph discuss in topic
10:27
1.3 but let's say give given this table here and we were not given this function
10:32
right how would you go about solving this on a no calculator portion of the AP right you won't be able to draw a
10:38
graph because you don't know what the function is the function as you could see it is only defined by these four values how would you find the limit
10:45
using only a table take a second and think about it can you find the limit as this one approaches
10:53
four can you find the limit of this graph as X approaches -5
11:04
five okay let's take a look at this so we see here that from both directions as X increases or decreases as it increases
11:12
from this direction decreases from this direction as it gets infinitely closer to X is equal to four we are getting
11:17
closer and closer to five therefore this one is simply five but this one's a
11:24
little bit more complicated right from this direction it's coming and it's negative one from this direction is
11:30
negative it's it's positive one right what's the difference well here as we
11:36
even as we change X Y is not changing from this direction and neither is it changing from this direction we can see
11:42
if we were to take a one-sided limit that the limit as we approach from C
11:48
negative right or right is equal to negative 1 and the
11:54
limit as we approach from the right is equal to positive
12:01
1 and because the one-sided limits are not equal that means the limit does not
12:07
exist so the limit of this function as we approach
12:12
five is D NE does not exists and how can we tell that from the table well as we
12:17
change X from this direction we change X from this direction this one is staying at one it's going to continue being one
12:22
as we approach five this one's going to continue being a negative one as we approach five as well topic 1.5 determining limits using
Topic 1.5 - Determining Limits Using Algebraic Properties of Limits
12:30
algebraic properties of limits this is a fairly simple topic but it's certainly an important one and though we're going to get more into determining limits
12:36
using algebraic manipulation in topic 1.6 this is important for just knowing some properties that you can use to help
12:43
solve those limit problems in the future the first one we have is constant multiple so when we have a multiple
12:49
let's say three we multiply by a function f ofx let's say x s then what we can transform this into using
12:55
limitate properties is three of limit X x^2 and I'm not putting the X um Arrow C
13:02
you should but this is shorthand so for the sum and the difference these are both the same just a different
13:09
difference between a plus and a minus but of course when you add a negative number it's the same thing as subtracting when we have the limit of
13:15
two functions added together let's say x^2 + X4 x 4 we can split that into X2
13:22
and then X4 X 4th right we can split those up same thing goes for difference
13:28
and and for a product it's the same idea and same thing with a quotient when we have two functions that are related to
13:34
each other by one of these operators you know plus minus um divide and multiply we have a
13:42
two functions that are related like that we can just split them apart into their own limits and evaluate them separately
13:47
now for the power it's a little bit different if we have our power rule here right this is raised to a power we can
13:54
just evaluate the limit first and then raise it to that power same thing with a root because of course course you know
13:59
root and a rational exponent it's the same idea right we can evaluate the limit and then the limit of the function
14:06
like this or we can just take the nth root after we take the limit of the function okay topic 1.6 determining
Topic 1.6 - Determining Limits Using Algebraic Manipulation
14:12
limits using algebraic manipulation this is by far the easiest way to solve a limit if it's possible now you can only
14:19
really do this if you have if you're given an equation if you're only given a graph or a table and ask to find the
14:24
limit of a point there you cannot do that you cannot do that using this method method but if you're given a
14:30
function right there are several different ways to solve and it depends on the function family that you're given
14:36
let's say have a polinomial function something like X 4th plus X 3r Plus X the 2nd plus X the 1st right we're
14:44
trying to find the limit of this function as X approaches four right what
14:49
is this equal to well as we see here our rule is that we just simply plug in C and this is our C value right so we
14:57
would get 4 4 plus 4 3r + 4 the 2 + 4 and that is equal to our answer on the
15:05
AP you do not need to simplify you do not need to simplify this answer you can just leave it like this okay do not try
15:11
to simplify because you might make a mistake and it'll also cost you time you have limited time on that exam it's best
15:17
not to waste it now rational functions first thing you should do is always
15:23
remember to factor the numerator and the denominator right let's say we have the limit as X approaches 2 of x + 2 * x - 2
15:30
over x - 2 if we were to plug two in here immediately we would get zero right
15:35
we get 2 - 2 in the denominator we just get zero right so what we need to do is we need
15:42
to factor this out all right these two cancel this cancels here and we get the limit as X approaches 2 of x + 2 now
15:51
we're in polinomial form so we can just plug this in and we get four all right now r radical functions
15:59
are a little bit different there's something special you have to do here that you might remember from Algebra 2 if not be sure to check out that video
16:06
but we need to rationalize the denominator so if we have a function that's in the form like this
16:13
right A over B minus otk C we have to multiply by the conjugate which is like
16:19
the reverse sign right times the top and the bottom and then we would get a form
16:26
that looks like this right we get a * B + < TK C over b^
16:32
2 right minus C so you have to rationalize that that denominator then once you do that you just plug in
16:39
whatever C value you get unless the nth root is positive and the radican would be negative because let's say if we took
16:45
the square root of something like -2 this is going to result in a complex number which is not what we
16:51
want the AP likely will not give you anything complicated like that now for a composite function for a composite
16:58
function let's say I have the fun function f of G ofx right the limit here x approach is C what you want to do is
17:05
you find the limit of the inner function so use one of these above strategies or any other strategy to find the limit of
17:11
the inside function the inside function so you plug in C whatever you find the limit of G of X just treat it as
17:18
limb all right like this then to find the outside function you're going to get
17:23
some value this is going to be R right what you want to find then is you have the limit as X approaches R of the
17:30
outside function that's how You' find that value remember it's not you're not doing C in
17:35
the outside function you're doing R and that is topic 1.6 okay so here
Topic 1.7 - Selecting Procedures for Determining Limits & Topic 1.9 - Connecting Multiple Representations of Limits
17:41
we've combined topics 1.7 and 1.9 because they're both essentially practice topics what the college board
17:48
says in their course and exam description that there's no new content for these topics just a practice question so evaluate this limit here
17:55
I'll give you a couple seconds to do it all right now I'm going to get rid of
18:00
these answer boxes here we're going to go over
18:06
it okay so the first thing is we're going to use our algebraic manipulation strategies from topic 1.5 so we can
18:14
bring out this constant multiple and put it here right we bring out the constant multiple the next thing we can do is factor out an X from the top right we're
18:21
just factoring out an X up here then these X's cancel and we're left with this
18:27
right now now we are left with a rational function there is no way to divide this rational function up right
18:34
we cannot factor out anything here so we're left with this we're going
18:40
to plug in our C values right we're plugging in our C value here and we're left with this number here right we're
18:48
left with this number here 5 * 6 over 48 which equal 30 over 48 which is equal to
18:53
625 now you may be thinking you could factor out a three here right you could
18:58
factor out of three yes you could um but it doesn't really matter at this point right you can just you can just put it
19:05
in immediately um to take out a constant multiple is really only to help you and
19:11
here's what I'm thinking right when I solve this I see that if I have three * 9x minus 2 then my constant multiple
19:17
becomes right would become 5 over three which is harder for me to multiply than if I just keep it right it's harder for
19:23
me to multiply that so I'm just going to leave it topic one point 8 determining limits
Topic 1.8 - Determining Limits Using the Squeeze Theorem
19:30
using the squeeze theorem so the squeeze theorem can be used to evaluate the limit of a function if we have this
19:36
function that's bounded by two other functions so if we're trying to find the limit of a function at a point and we
19:41
need two other functions that means we need three total and the first function right has to be less than or equal to
19:47
the function we actually need right this is the function we need this is the function we're trying to find the limit of right and this function must be
19:54
greater than over the intervals surrounding but not necessarily including the point x equals c so if we
20:00
had let's say a function here and this is all true but then like there's a random thing that's defined up here for
20:05
that function it doesn't matter because if this is C right we're only looking at the interval surrounding c not
20:11
necessarily at C right if these if this is true under these conditions if the
20:17
limit is equal if the limit of the bottom function at a point is equal to the limit of the top function at a point
20:23
equal the same thing right then the limit of the middle function is equal to that same point take a look at an
20:30
example here okay we have a top function right we have a bottom function here we
20:35
have a top function we have a bottom function okay this is always in between
20:41
these two functions for the interval surrounding C let's call C 0 this one is equal to zero right the limit as we
20:47
approach as we approach zero of this function is zero same thing for this one
20:53
by the squeeze theorem therefore we can say that this limit is also equal to zero
20:58
okay now you'll notice why we have to use the squeeze theorem it's because when we have something like this the real image of this right if we zoom in
21:05
we get something like this and this is a little bit more complicated to evaluate so we can just use the squeeze
21:11
theorem we can see that this is in fact actually zero okay now here's an algebraic example this is very
21:18
interesting if we have two functions and we know we know like those the the value
21:24
of those function we know the limit value of these functions right let's say we have something like the limit of 10 tan XX right tangent XX right if we know
21:33
that we can make this look like functions that we already know the limit of then we can use this idea to kind of
21:41
transfer our knowledge so let's say if that looks if that seems abstract to let's take a look at an example here so
21:46
tangent X overx this equal to you know we have tan tan of X is equal to sin x over cos x right so we're going to we're
21:53
going to put into this equivalent form then we're going to kind of algebraically manipulate it a little bit and then we can use the squeeze theorem
22:02
okay so this value here right as X approaches zero and this value here is X
22:08
approach to zero they're both going to be equal to one okay therefore because both of these
22:15
are equal to one and we can just multiply equal to one right but we can also use a squeeze theorem if this top
22:22
function this bottom function are both equal to one then this one also must be equal to one by The Squeeze theorem but
22:29
what we also saw here right is through algebraic manipulation as we saw earlier if we split this up into two different
22:34
limits evaluate them separately we still get one but the squeeze theorem kind of proved this because if you were to graph
22:40
all this out right then you would get a bottom function a middle function and a
22:45
top function and those would be equal to one at the same point the next topic of discussion in
Topic 1.10 - Exploring Types of Discontinuities
22:53
the unit of limits and continuity is of course continuity but to explore continuity we also need to explore
22:59
discontinuity discontinuity occurs at vertical ASM tootes jump discontinuities
23:05
oscillating behavior and removable discontinuities we're going to get into that last one in a little bit but first
23:11
we're going to go over those first three so a vertical ASM toote is right here
23:17
and notice these are essentially the same as when a limit doesn't exist right we see here there is clearly a
23:23
discontinuity here vertical asot example okay let's take a look oscillating
23:29
Behavior we see oscillating Behavior also a discontinuity the last one here is Jump
23:35
discontinuity this a little bit new basically when we have a function that makes a jump essentially right here we
23:41
have a jump right that's called a jump discontinuity and it is a type of discontinuity this is basically only
23:48
seen in a function that has either absolute value X overx something like that or a pie wise function all right
Topic 1.11 - Defining Continuity at a Point
23:56
topic 111 defining concept continuity at a point we previously discussed discontinuities but it's always good to
24:03
have a rigorous definition of what continuity is and there are multiple
24:08
different types of discontinuities that we should always be aware of okay so a function is continuous at xal C if and
24:16
only if firstly the function exists at that point secondly the limit exists
24:22
meaning that the two-sided limits are equal right this limit here is equal to
24:29
to this limmit here right if those two limits are equal and if these two things
24:36
are equal to each other right so we have another rule if
24:44
the function G is continuous at C and if the function f is continuous at G of c and the composition F of G is
24:52
continuous at C given these rules let's take a look at
24:57
an example question given G of X below is G ofx continuous at X is equal to 2 take a second and see
25:05
if you can solve that okay G to get rid of this Square
25:14
here and we're going to take a look at the answer so firstly we need to evaluate both sides of the limit okay
25:22
now we know that if we have this here then we're going to have something only at two and then we're going to have
25:27
something that's going to be the same type of function either side of two right well we can split this into right
25:35
here we can split this into a limit here it's so limit as we approach two remember it's everywhere but two so we
25:41
know that it approach twos from both sides we can expand it to like be like this we just cancel out the xus 2s and
25:47
we get four okay but the real G of two is three
25:52
so we found that this exists right this exists this is equal to three we found that this exists because the two side
25:58
limits are equal and it's four right but three is not equal to four so G of X is not continuous at xals
26:07
2 even though the limit exists it is not continuous okay topic 1.12 confirming
Topic 1.12 - Confirming Continuity over an Interval
26:13
continuity over an interval so in topic 1.11 we confirm continuity at a point unsurprisingly for a function to be
26:20
continuous over an interval it just means that the definition for continuity at a point is satisfied for the entire
26:26
interval now to be continuous on the closed interval
26:31
AB a function has to be continuous but the left one-sided limit must also be equal to F of a and the right side limit
26:38
must also be equal to F of B essentially this is just a definition of a closed function we including the end points
26:45
there are several types of functions that are always continuous over their entire domains pols power functions
26:52
exponential functions absolute value functions rational functions logarithmic functions and trigonometric functions
26:58
okay that was a lot now we also have a similar rule to 1.11 right if the function G is continuous over an
27:05
interval and the function f is continuous over the same interval then the composition of the two is also continuous over that
27:11
interval now given all of this information let's try an example question take a second and see if you
27:16
can solve this okay we're going to get rid of our
27:22
box here given F ofx = 3^ 2x - 1 show that f
27:27
ofx is continuous over the domain negative Infinity positive by so basically every real number by
27:33
expressing as a composition well we have a composition here G ofx of H ofx is how
27:39
we're going to call it and our h of X is 2x minus one and our G of X is 2x is 3 to the power of X this is an exponential
27:46
function this is a linear function right we know from this list up here that those are always continuous therefore
27:53
this function is also always continuous topic 1.13 is pretty self-explanatory
Topic 1.13 - Removing Discontinuities
27:59
removing discontinuities for a removable dis discontinuity to exist at a point C that
28:05
means that the limit exists so the the the two-sided limit right basically exists so we're approaching let's say we
28:12
have C here we're approaching it from the same side we're approaching the same point but at this actual point it's
28:18
defined somewhere else like let's say here and we could remove this discontinuity by making the function
28:24
defined where it should be right where where the limit tells us right where the limit is equal
28:30
to at that point let's take a look at a 2012 AP Calculus AB release exam question this
28:37
is multiple choice question number nine take a second and see if you can solve
28:45
it okay let's get rid of our box here let F be the function defined above the
28:50
pie wise function for what value of K is f going to be continuous at xals
28:55
2 all right so we have this function right we're going to try to find the limit of both of these both of these
29:02
right here first thing I notied is that we can just cross this out these are going to factor right and we're going to get 2x + one so the limit the limit
29:11
here as we approach two is we as we plug in right we have a we have a linear functions we just plug in C now is going
29:18
to be equal to five and so that means that the limit right the limit of f ofx as we approach
29:26
2 is equal to five for it to be continu continuous this needs to be equal to
29:32
right it needs to be equal to it right so that means that F of
29:38
two must be equal to five so K must be equal to five our answer is e this is
Topic 1.14 - Connecting Infinite Limits and Vertical Asymptotes
29:44
our third to last topic topic 1.14 connecting infinite limits in vertical asmp tootes so what is an infinite limit
29:52
an infinite limit is when at any given point c f ofx can be described to be
29:58
equal to positive or negative Infinity now the limit still does not exist here
30:04
some calculus books are a little bit wary on this on whether it does or does not exist generally it is accepted that
30:10
this limit does not exist because for a limit to be defined it usually has to equal a real number so let's say at zero
30:17
right what's the limit of this function as X approaches zero well we come from this side and it looks like it could be
30:24
Infinity when we come from the other side it looks like it could be negative Infinity
30:30
right this shows right an infinite limit this is an infinite onesided limit
30:36
another infinite one-sided limit right where when we approach this point we're going towards either negative or
30:42
positive Infinity in this example some calculus textbooks might assert that the limit as X approaches zero of this
30:50
function is equal to Infinity because no matter which side we go from we are approaching Infinity as we approach
30:56
zero but for the purposes of the AP Calculus courses we're going to say that this limit does not exist because we're
31:03
at a vertical ASM toote however it is a good idea for you to know what an infinite limit is and again it's very
31:09
simple at an infinite limit it just means that the graph seems like it's going towards either positive or
31:16
negative Infinity topic 1.15 our second to last topic connecting limits at
Topic 1.15 - Connecting Limits at Infinity and Horizontal Asymptotes
31:22
infinity and horizontal ASM tootes so in topic 1.14 we discussed what an infinite
31:28
limit is this is a limmit at Infinity so what does that mean well you can see
31:33
here it's simply written as X instead of C we have a positive or negative Infinity it's not this it's
31:43
not this okay this is here for a limit at Infinity now the limit of a function
31:51
at Infinity can be approximated by simply plugging in Infinity okay so if we had like a polinomial we plugged in
31:57
Infinity for X in that polinomial we would clearly see right that that polinomial is either going to grow
32:03
towards either positive or negative Infinity depending on the degree or depending on the leading coefficients degree
32:09
right now the behavior right the behavior of this
32:14
function is represented by positive or negative Infinity if there's unbounded
32:19
positive or negative behavior but again this limit doesn't exist because Infinity is not an integer so whenever
32:26
you get that limit right when ever you evaluate something like this and it is not equal to a number the limit
32:32
technically does not exist there's a special thing here if we have a limit of a rational function it's going to depend
32:38
on the degree of the numerator and the denominator so again a rational function is we have F ofx over G of X okay if the
32:46
degree of the numerator so this one right here is less than this one it's going to be zero we can see that pretty clearly let's say if we have like sorry
32:54
that was a bad Infinity if we have Infinity to the squar over infinity cub Cub right obviously this is going to
33:01
grow to zero right we're going to skip the middle one but if we go
33:06
to here right if we had say infinity cubed over infinity squared that would
33:13
grow obviously towards Infinity but if they're equal if we have
33:18
infinity squared over infinity squared this would be equal to one but if we
33:23
have it equal to 5/3 it will be equal to 5/3 it all depends on the ratio the leading coefficients why because these
33:30
are just going to cancel and any other terms that are in the top of this thing that are smaller right that are not part
33:36
of the leading degree are going to become negligible as we increase to Infinity so if you have a rational
33:42
function here and the degrees are equal in the top and the bottom eventually as X as as X approaches Infinity here it's
33:49
just going to become equal to the ratio of the leading coefficients let's take a look at some example questions
33:55
here take a second see if you can solve these all right the first one we see the degree is one in the top degree is one
34:01
in the bottom we can use our rules this will become 3 fths next one the degree on the bottom is larger than the degree
34:08
on the top so this is going to be zero and the last one this is going to be Infinity because the degree on the top is larger than the degree on the bottom
34:14
bing bing bang and we are done okay in topic 1.16 we're working with a theorem called the intermediate value theorem
Topic 1.16 - Working with the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)
34:21
and this at first is going to sound very abstract and possibly very complicated but once we go over the example it's
34:26
going to simplify everything for you I promise so if there is a continuous function f ofx on a closed interval A
34:34
and K is any number in between F of a and F of B inclusive there is an x value C on AB for which FC is equal to K and
34:40
that probably sounded like a lot of gibberish we're going to take a look at this example we're going to figure it out so let's say we in this example our
34:47
a is zero so this is a and this is B right this here is B okay this is going to be F of a
34:56
right and this is going to be F of B this makes sense right this makes sense
35:01
this function has to be continuous it's on this closed interval it's continuous over this closed interval right there is
35:06
no gaps there's no discontinuities okay if K is any number in between here
35:12
so K is any y value from from positive one all the way down from positive one
35:18
all the way down tog3 right then there is an x value C for Which F of C is
35:23
equal to K and if you just use logic right basic logic here this makes sense
35:30
okay there has to be some value right some value here where K is represented
35:37
right because if we're going from here to here then every single point within here to here has to be has to exist so
35:44
let's say I wanted K to be equal toga1 let's say k equals ne1 then at this
35:50
point whatever this x value is this is equal to C right because K is equal to negative 1 here I wanted K to be equal
35:56
to -2 it could be here if I want K to be zero be here any point in between here K is defined for okay this works for any
36:03
continuous function on a Clos interval and that is the intermediate
36:09
value theorem"""
