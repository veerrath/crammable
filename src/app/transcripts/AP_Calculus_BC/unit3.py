"""remember that chain rule gives us a way
1:04
to differentiate composite functions and
1:06
a composite function is just a function
1:08
of another function so these are all
1:10
composite functions because we have the
1:12
function x cubed plus 2x nested inside
1:15
of the sine function the exponential
1:17
function and this power function and
1:20
remember that chain rule tells us that
1:22
when we want to differentiate a
1:23
composite function like one of these we
1:26
apply it in two steps first we take the
1:28
derivative of the outside function
1:30
ignoring the inside function so if we
1:33
apply this first step to these three
1:35
functions here's what that looks like
1:36
the derivative of this first sine
1:38
function we take the derivative of the
1:40
outside well the derivative of sine is
1:42
cosine so we get cosine and now here we
1:45
ignore the inside function so we ignore
1:47
x cubed plus 2x that's step one of the
1:51
chain rule for this first function for
1:54
the second function we know that the
1:56
derivative of an exponential will just
1:58
be that same exponential function so
2:00
differentiating the outside we still
2:02
just get e to the X cubed plus 2x in
2:05
other words we just ignore the exponent
2:07
for now because that's our inside
2:08
function for the third function when we
2:11
take the derivative we address the power
2:13
function
2:13
so we have three then the inside
2:15
function race to the power of two so we
2:18
treated it as a power function we bring
2:19
the two down in front so we get six and
2:21
for now we'll ignore that inside
2:24
function 2-1 and the exponent gives us
2:27
one no need to write an exponent of one
2:30
that's step one of the chain rule step
2:32
two of the chain rule tells us that we
2:34
then have to multiply by the derivative
2:35
of what's inside that inside function
2:38
for all three of these is x cubed plus
2:40
2x so we multiply by that derivative
2:43
well the derivative of x cubed plus 2x
2:46
is 3x squared plus two which means that
2:51
we then take each of these functions and
2:53
we multiply by three x squared plus two
2:56
so that's step two of the chain rule for
2:58
the trig function here we multiply by
3:01
three x squared plus two and here we
3:04
multiply by three x squared plus two and
3:09
now we have each of our three
3:10
derivatives we just need to simplify as
3:13
long as we remember these two steps with
3:15
chain rule we'll be able to apply it to
3:17
any function that's a composite function
3:20
and then the last thing we want to
3:22
remember with chain rule is that we'll
3:23
often have to apply it with other
3:25
derivative rules this for example is a
3:27
rational function which means we'll need
3:29
to apply quotient rule to take its
3:31
derivative but you can see we have all
3:33
of these composite functions nested
3:35
within the numerator and denominator so
3:37
we'll have to use chain rule and
3:39
quotient rule together plus product rule
3:41
and power rule in order to take its
3:43
derivative and when you have something
3:45
complicated like this the best thing to
3:47
do is to build an outline first and then
3:50
take the derivative of each piece
3:51
separately so instead of trying to go
3:53
through this in order and potentially
3:55
risk getting lost and disorganize losing
3:58
your place and the derivative just go
4:00
ahead and build an outline we'll say
4:02
that the derivative is f prime of x is
4:04
equal to we know this is quotient rule
4:07
and quotient rule looks like this we
4:09
take the derivative of the numerator
4:11
multiplied by the denominator minus the
4:14
numerator times the derivative of the
4:16
denominator all divided by the
4:19
denominator squared we know that's going
4:22
to be our outline for this rational
4:23
function then let's build each of these
4:26
pieces
4:27
so here away from the derivative
4:30
function what you want to do is find the
4:32
derivative of the numerator the
4:34
numerator itself the derivative of the
4:36
denominator the denominator and then if
4:39
you wanted to you could also find the
4:41
denominator squared since we'll need
4:42
that here for our quotient rule formula
4:45
find these pieces separately and then
4:47
plug them into your derivative function
4:49
obviously when we take each piece
4:51
separately the numerator is obvious we
4:54
just take the entire numerator here from
4:56
the original function the denominator is
4:58
obvious we just take the denominator the
5:00
denominator squared is easy when we take
5:03
the denominator here and we square it
5:04
instead of raising this to the power of
5:06
two we'll get this to the power of four
5:08
so we'll get 3x to the fourth minus 6x
5:12
plus two all raised to the power of four
5:14
and then all that we're left with is the
5:17
derivative of the denominator and the
5:20
derivative of the numerator so we can
5:22
focus in on each of those pieces find
5:24
them somewhere away from this formula
5:26
once we have every piece calculated
5:28
individually then we can go ahead and
5:30
plug it back into our derivative
5:32
function so when it comes to implicitly
3.2 Implicit Differentiation
5:38
defined functions we want to distinguish
5:40
between x and y variables so when it
5:43
comes to x variables we want to
5:45
differentiate those like normal like we
5:48
always have so in unit 2 we learned all
5:50
about derivative rules we did power rule
5:52
product rule quotient rule and we always
5:54
were differentiating X like a variable
5:57
and we want to continue doing that
5:58
nothing changes about how we treat X
6:01
when we take a derivative but we're
6:03
going to start differentiating Y and
6:05
when we differentiate Y when we take the
6:08
derivative of Y we're going to first
6:10
differentiate it just like we would X
6:13
we're going to sort of treat it like a
6:14
variable just like we would take the
6:16
derivative of x we're going to take the
6:18
derivative of Y however after we do that
6:21
we then need to multiply by Y prime or
6:24
dy over DX because Y is a function of X
6:28
which means we have to apply chain rule
6:30
to take its derivative so for example if
6:33
you come across in a function 3x squared
6:37
you recognize you need to use power rule
6:38
you take the derivative
6:40
the derivative there is 6x when you come
6:44
across 3y squared you want to take its
6:47
derivative well you treat Y first
6:49
exactly like you would X so the
6:52
derivative is 6y however then you have
6:55
to apply this blue piece because you're
6:57
just differentiated Y you now need to
6:59
multiply either by Y prime and so your
7:02
derivative is 6y Y prime or you could
7:06
write it this way you could say 6y and
7:08
then multiply by dy over DX one more
7:13
example you come across sine of x
7:18
squared you want to take the derivative
7:20
you do that like normal you take the
7:23
derivative using chain rule and you say
7:24
cosine of x squared but then we have to
7:28
multiply by 2x because that's the
7:31
derivative of the inside function so
7:32
there's our chain rule application
7:34
there's your derivative but if we want
7:36
to find the derivative of sine of Y
7:40
squared then we first treat Y just like
7:44
we would X and we say okay the
7:45
derivative is cosine of Y squared and
7:49
then we multiply by the inside function
7:51
- y and so we've accomplished this first
7:54
part we've differentiated just like we
7:56
would X however then we apply the blue
7:59
part once that first part is done we
8:01
have to multiply by Y prime or by dy
8:03
over DX so let's just say we chose dy
8:07
over DX and there is our derivative of
8:10
sine of Y squared so always remember
8:12
those two parts let's look at one
8:14
example really quickly to make the point
8:16
also that all of our other derivative
8:18
rules still apply so when we have a
8:20
function like this one we can work
8:22
straight from left to right through both
8:24
sides of the equation we always have to
8:26
remember to differentiate both sides of
8:28
the equation but let's start with this
8:29
3x squared e to the Y well we have to
8:32
use product rule here because we have
8:33
two functions we have 3x squared and we
8:36
have e to the Y so if we set a product
8:38
rule we'll set up an outline here we
8:41
know product rule our outline is going
8:42
to look like this so the derivative here
8:45
will take the derivative of 3x squared
8:47
that's just like normal that's 6x then
8:50
according to product rule we just
8:51
multiply by the other function so e to
8:54
the
8:54
we didn't differentiate this part with
8:57
the y in it so we don't have to multiply
8:59
by Y Prime or by dy over DX but then we
9:02
calculate the other half of our product
9:04
rule formula this time we leave 3x
9:06
squared alone so 3x squared but then we
9:09
have to differentiate e to the Y this is
9:12
the first time we're differentiating a Y
9:13
well we treat Y exactly as we would X so
9:16
the derivative of e to the Y is e to the
9:19
Y but then we have to multiply by Y
9:22
prime or dy over DX because we just took
9:24
the derivative of something with Y in it
9:27
so we multiply by dy over DX this second
9:31
part here minus 2y over Ln of X well we
9:35
could do this with quotient rule or we
9:37
could separate the Y out from the
9:38
fraction and do it with product rule
9:40
let's go ahead and do it with quotient
9:42
rule so let's go ahead and build a
9:44
quotient rule outline we know we'll have
9:46
the derivative of the numerator times
9:48
the denominator minus the numerator
9:51
times the derivative of the denominator
9:53
all divided by the denominator squared
9:58
there's our quotient rule outline and
10:00
now let's go ahead and apply quotient
10:02
rule so here we take the derivative of
10:04
the numerator well that's just going to
10:06
be two but then we have to multiply by
10:09
dy over DX multiplied by the denominator
10:14
minus the numerator 2y times the
10:18
derivative of the denominator well the
10:20
derivative of Ln of X is 1 over X and
10:23
then we have the denominator squared so
10:25
Ln of x squared we can simplify from
10:27
there and then of course the last thing
10:29
we always have to remember is on the
10:31
right hand side we have a constant but
10:33
we still have to differentiate that the
10:35
derivative of a constant is always zero
10:36
so we need to make sure we get that zero
10:38
on the right side and then be really
10:41
careful here remember our goal is to
10:43
simplify this as much as possible and
10:45
solve for dy over DX well when we do
10:48
when we solve this for dy over DX here's
10:51
what we're going to get the thing I want
10:52
to point out here is that we have to be
10:54
really careful about signs on our dy
10:56
over DX function and that's because on
10:59
the AP test a lot of times they'll flip
11:01
around the signs in the answer to give
11:05
you an expression that's equivalent to
11:07
the one you found
11:08
but looks a little different because of
11:09
the way they've switched around the
11:10
signs for example you can see here in
11:12
our numerator we've got two negative
11:14
signs both terms are negative what they
11:16
might do is take these negative signs
11:19
factor out the negative and instead put
11:23
that in front of the fraction so they
11:25
put the negative sign out in front here
11:26
turn this into a positive and this into
11:29
a positive or they may take these two
11:31
terms here and swap them reordering the
11:34
terms and they could even go into the
11:36
denominator here and swap these terms
11:38
around factor out a negative sign and
11:40
change around the way that this answer
11:43
looks it's going to be an equivalent
11:44
expression they're just changing around
11:46
the signs so you have to be really
11:48
careful you may get the correct answer
11:50
but you may have to manipulate it a
11:52
little bit to match it up to the correct
11:54
answer on the AP exam so for topic 3.3
3.3 Differentiating Inverse Functions
12:03
differentiating inverse functions
12:05
there's really two kinds of problems
12:07
that show up most often on the AP test
12:09
and we really want to be able to handle
12:11
both of them the first thing we want to
12:13
remember is that when we're dealing with
12:15
inverse functions inverse functions
12:17
remember are just reflections of each
12:19
other over the line y equals x and they
12:22
just have their x and y values swapped
12:24
so here in this graph we have the
12:27
function y equals x cubed in purple and
12:31
we have the function x equals y cubed in
12:34
dark blue we have only swapped the
12:37
places of the x and y variables in those
12:39
two functions and you can see the result
12:42
here in the graph they look like perfect
12:44
mirror images of each other over this
12:46
line y equals x so just remember it they
12:49
have the variable swapped you change the
12:51
places of all the x and y variables and
12:53
their reflections of each other over the
12:56
line y equals x so what you'll often be
12:58
asked to do is start with a function
13:00
that looks normal
13:02
and let's go ahead and take this X cubed
13:04
function and you'll be asked to find its
13:07
inverse function but evaluated at a
13:10
particular point so let's say evaluated
13:12
at 2 so we need to find the inverse
13:14
function evaluated at x equals 2 so in
13:17
order to do that all we're going to do
13:19
is follow a simple set of steps
13:21
so we're going to remember that we can
13:22
write f of X is y so we're just going to
13:24
say y equals x cubed instead of f of X
13:28
we're going to swap X and y variables so
13:30
we're going to say x equals y cubed
13:33
instead then we're going to solve for y
13:35
and the way that we're going to do that
13:37
is by taking the cube root of both sides
13:39
so we're going to say X to the one-third
13:42
is equal to Y cubed and then raised to
13:46
the 1/3 power the reason we do that is
13:49
to cancel the exponent on the Y because
13:51
3 times 1/3 is 1 we get y to the first
13:54
over on the right hand side so we're
13:56
going to get X to the 1/3 is equal to Y
13:59
or we can rewrite that as y equals x to
14:04
the 1/3 and then in the same way that we
14:07
changed f of X into y we can change Y
14:09
back into so we'll rewrite this as the
14:13
inverse function is equal to x to the
14:19
1/3 now that we have the inverse
14:21
function we just need to find this value
14:24
by evaluating at x equals two so the
14:27
value then that we want to find will say
14:29
the inverse function at 2 is equal to we
14:33
plug 2 into the function here we get 2
14:35
to the 1/3 and it means we have the cube
14:39
root of 2 we could leave it that way we
14:41
could write it as the cube root of 2 and
14:44
that's our answer for that kind of
14:46
problem the other kind of problem that
14:48
will commonly be given is we'll be told
14:50
that F and G are both differentiable
14:53
functions and their inverses of one
14:54
another and knowing that they're
14:56
inverses of one another we have some
14:58
information about them let's say for
15:00
instance we know G of 1 is 9
15:04
we know that let's say F prime of 9 is 2
15:09
and we've been asked to find G prime of
15:13
1 let's say that's the problem we've
15:16
been given knowing that F and G are
15:18
inverses of each other here's how we
15:20
solve that we'll go ahead and draw some
15:23
coordinate axes and then we can start
15:25
labeling some points so we have the two
15:27
functions F and G we don't know what
15:29
they look like but we know some points
15:31
on each function so here we have G of 1
15:34
equals 9
15:35
so that means that when X is 1 G is
15:37
going to give us 9 so we can plot this
15:40
point here 1 9 and let's just go ahead
15:44
and put a G next to that so we know that
15:46
that relates to G because F and G are
15:49
inverses of each other we know that
15:51
there's a point on F it just has these
15:53
values flipped so if 1 9 is on G the
15:57
curve of G then 9 1 is on the curve of F
16:01
so we can come over here and say 9 1 is
16:04
may be right about here we'll call this
16:07
9 1 and we'll say that that relates to F
16:10
so we've addressed this piece of
16:13
information what about this piece F
16:15
prime of nine is 2 what that's saying is
16:17
that the derivative of the function f at
16:20
9 is equal to 2 or the slope of the
16:22
function at 9 is equal to 2 so if we
16:25
imagine a slope of roughly 2 that's
16:28
going to look something like this the
16:29
slope through this point at that point
16:32
might look something like that that's
16:34
what that piece of information is
16:36
telling us now we know that if these
16:38
functions are inverses of one another
16:40
then the slopes at these points also
16:42
have to be inverses and we can kind of
16:44
picture what that looks like here at 1/9
16:47
the slope would look something roughly
16:49
like this because remember we have
16:53
reflections of the curve over the line y
16:56
equals x if we call that the line y
16:58
equals x we have to have symmetry over
17:00
this line so that's roughly what the
17:03
slope should look like but in order to
17:05
calculate that all we have to realize
17:07
here is that if the slope over here is 2
17:10
so the slope at this point here is 2
17:13
then the slope of the function G at that
17:16
corresponding point has to be the
17:18
reciprocal so instead of 2 we literally
17:20
just take the reciprocal and the slope
17:23
at G has to be 1/2 so the slope over
17:25
here has to be 1/2 and that's what we've
17:29
been asked for is the slope of G when X
17:31
is equal to 1 and so this has to be
17:34
equal to 1/2 because 1/2 is the
17:36
reciprocal of the slope of the function
17:38
f at that corresponding point over the
17:41
line we could also go ahead and write in
17:43
here our other piece of information we
17:45
found that F of 9 is equal to
17:49
one and those are now our four
17:51
corresponding pieces of information G of
17:54
1 equals 9 is the corresponding piece of
17:56
information to F of 9 equals 1 and these
17:59
reciprocal slopes are corresponding
18:01
pieces of information at these two
18:03
corresponding points now for inverse
3.4 Differentiating Inverse Trigonometric Functions
18:11
trig functions and remember those are
18:13
these functions here we'll also see
18:15
these retinas y equals arc sine of X R
18:17
cosine of X arc tan arc cosecant arc
18:21
secant arc cotangent so those are
18:23
equivalent notations but for these
18:26
inverse trig functions we're going to
18:28
need to know the formulas for their
18:30
derivatives and I really would recommend
18:32
memorizing these formulas if at all
18:34
possible because you're going to be
18:36
pressed for time on the AP exam and you
18:38
don't want to be deriving you don't want
18:40
to be generating these formulas building
18:42
these formulas yourself even though you
18:44
can do that if you have them memorized
18:46
you can move quickly and not spend time
18:49
coming up with these yourself so I would
18:52
recommend memorizing these formulas and
18:53
then there's really only two key things
18:55
we need to remember about applying these
18:58
to find inverse trig derivatives the
19:00
first thing is to choose the correct X
19:03
so let's say for instance that instead
19:05
of being given y equals inverse cosecant
19:08
of X were instead given y equals inverse
19:12
cosecant of 3 x squared well remember
19:18
this formula is based on having X as the
19:22
argument of the inverse cosecant
19:23
function well here our argument is 3 x
19:26
squared
19:27
not X which means that in these two
19:29
spots here for this X and this X we need
19:32
to use 3x squared instead of the X so
19:34
the first thing to remember is to always
19:36
pick the correct X or use the correct X
19:39
so we know that the derivative here then
19:41
is going to be negative 1 divided by and
19:46
then instead of absolute value of x
19:48
absolute value of 3x squared and then
19:53
instead of square root of x squared
19:54
minus 1 we're going to get square root
19:56
of 3x squared quantity squared minus 1
20:00
and
20:02
we can simplify this expression for our
20:04
derivative that's the derivative so
20:06
number one pick the correct X number two
20:08
if the argument is anything other than X
20:11
like it is here we have three x squared
20:14
instead of just X we need to apply chain
20:16
rule and multiply by the derivative of
20:18
that inside function so the derivative
20:20
of 3x squared is 6x which means that
20:24
this is actually not our derivative
20:26
function we have to multiply here by 6x
20:30
and now this is actually our correct
20:32
derivative function so the two key
20:35
things you want to watch out for are use
20:37
the correct X whichever X you're given
20:39
here you want to put that into the
20:42
formula everywhere where you have an X
20:43
and then the second thing is to multiply
20:47
by the derivative of what's inside if
20:48
you have any argument other than X you
20:52
go ahead and apply chain rule and you
20:53
multiply it by the derivative of that
20:55
inside function topic three point five
3.5 Selecting Procedures for Calculating Derivatives
21:02
is all about figuring out which
21:04
derivative rules we're going to need to
21:05
apply to take the derivative of a
21:07
particular function so let's say we
21:10
start with this one as an example
21:11
there's two key things that we want to
21:13
take away from this topic first is
21:16
figuring out what derivative rules we
21:17
need to use and then second is kind of
21:19
figuring out the order in which you need
21:21
to use them and if we start with the
21:23
order in which we need to use them you
21:25
always want to work from the outside of
21:28
the function toward the inside of the
21:30
function so in this particular case we
21:33
wouldn't start by focusing on let's say
21:35
this 9x squared which is buried deep
21:38
inside the function we would instead
21:39
step back we would take a look at what
21:41
we have here and we would say oh this is
21:43
a fraction it's a rational function
21:44
therefore my first derivative role my
21:47
primary derivative rule is of course
21:50
going to be quotient rule because I have
21:52
a quotient here so this is my primary
21:56
derivative I'm working from the outside
21:58
I'm starting from the outside and
21:59
overall my function here is a quotient
22:02
then I work toward the inside and I say
22:04
okay what else am I going to need well I
22:06
say I have secant of X so I know I'm
22:09
going to need the trig rule the trig
22:12
derivative of the secant function I
22:15
and see in the denominator I have a
22:16
product I have 9 x squared plus 2 x the
22:20
other function e to the 4x I have the
22:22
product of two functions so I know I'm
22:25
going to need product rule as well when
22:28
I deal with that denominator of course
22:30
I'm gonna need power rule I can see for
22:32
example I have this 9x squared here so I
22:35
know I'm going to need power rule and I
22:38
have e to the 4x with this 4x nested
22:41
inside of the exponential function
22:43
that's a composite so I know I'm gonna
22:45
need chain rule as well so the idea here
22:50
is just to be able to look quickly at a
22:52
function think through all of the
22:54
derivative rules you might use but most
22:56
importantly focus on working from the
22:58
outside toward the inside to figure out
23:00
what your primary rule is what this
23:02
means is that when I take the derivative
23:04
of this function I'm going to build an
23:06
outline for the quotient rule and then
23:08
all these other rules are going to get
23:09
applied inside of that quotient rule
23:11
derivative if on the other hand we wrap
23:15
this function in parenthesis and we
23:18
raise it to the second power like this
23:20
now my primary rule is instead the power
23:23
rule because this is a power function
23:26
I've got this thing nested inside here
23:28
but essentially I have something raised
23:30
to the power of 2 that's a power
23:32
function so power rule is going to be my
23:34
overriding rule and then inside of that
23:36
I'm gonna start nesting in quotient rule
23:39
and the rule for the derivative of
23:41
secant and product rule and chain rule
23:43
so always think work from the outside
23:45
toward the inside and maybe make a list
23:48
ahead of time before you start a problem
23:49
like this of the rules that you know
23:51
you're going to use in order to take the
23:53
derivative
3.6 Calculating Higher-Order Derivatives
23:58
okay so talking about higher-order
24:00
derivatives which are going to be your
24:02
second derivatives third derivatives
24:03
fourth derivatives but primarily we're
24:05
dealing with second derivatives remember
24:07
that the second derivative is just the
24:09
derivative of the first derivative the
24:11
second derivative is the derivative of
24:13
the first derivative so if you're given
24:14
a function y then the first derivative
24:18
you might write as Y Prime and the
24:22
second derivative you might write as y
24:24
double prime or if you're given a
24:26
function let's call it f of X and you
24:29
find the first derivative you're going
24:31
to write that as f prime of X and then
24:33
of course your second derivative is
24:35
going to be f double prime of X and
24:37
you're just differentiating each time so
24:40
the second derivative is the derivative
24:41
of the first derivative and on the AP
24:44
test they'll often talk about twice
24:48
differentiable functions you'll see this
24:50
in questions a twice differentiable
24:53
function and that just means that not
24:56
only is the original function defined
24:58
but the first derivative and the second
25:00
derivative are also defined so if twice
25:03
differentiable function means that all
25:04
three of these are defined functions of
25:07
course you take the second derivative
25:09
using all the same derivative rules that
25:11
you would used on the first derivative
25:13
you just differentiate again when it
25:15
comes to implicit functions implicitly
25:18
defined functions let's say for instance
25:19
we've been given this function is the
25:21
original function its first derivative
25:24
is this here dy over DX we already found
25:27
the first derivative then we went and
25:29
differentiated this and found the second
25:30
derivative so this is the second
25:32
derivative of this original implicitly
25:34
defined function the thing you have to
25:36
remember here when you're
25:37
differentiating and implicitly defined
25:39
function is that in the second
25:41
derivative you're going to end up with
25:43
these values here for dy DX or Y prime
25:46
depending on how you write it but this
25:48
first derivative these indicate here the
25:51
first derivative so what you need to do
25:53
is take your first derivative function
25:55
that you found and remember to plug it
25:58
in to any spot where you have that first
26:03
derivative nested inside of your second
26:06
derivative so once you find the second
26:08
derivative
26:08
your last step will be to plug this
26:10
first derivative into those spots and
26:13
then simplify the second derivative as
26:15
much as you can when you're dealing with
26:17
an implicitly defined function like this
26:19
one okay so that's it for unit 3 you
Summary
26:24
really want to make sure that you know
26:25
how to use chain rule to differentiate
26:27
composite functions and apply chain rule
26:29
alongside other derivative rules like
26:32
power product and quotient rule you want
26:34
to be able to differentiate inverse and
26:36
implicit functions and you want to know
26:39
how to find higher-order derivatives
26:40
both for explicitly defined functions
26:43
and for implicitly defined functions
26:45
once you're good to go on unit 3 make
26:48
sure to come back and move on to unit 4
26:49
where we'll dig in to applications of
26:52
differentiation"""
