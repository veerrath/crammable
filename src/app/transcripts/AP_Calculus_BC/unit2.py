"""Jonathan and we're moving on to unit two
0:01
of a calculus AB and BC this unit makes
0:04
up 10 to 12% of calculus AB and 4 to 7%
0:07
of BC and it's a key unit that lays the
0:10
foundation for the rest of both
0:12
courses on the left you can see all the
0:15
topics in unit 2 2.1 through 2.10 let's
Topic 2.1
0:18
start off with topic 2.1 defining
0:20
average and instantaneous rates of
0:22
change at a
0:23
point um let's start off with the two
0:25
limit definitions of a derivative shown
0:27
here on the left you need to have both
0:29
these definitions memorized and be able
0:31
to recognize limits in this form onto
0:33
some interpretations the main thing to
0:35
know is that calculus is really all
0:37
about
0:39
change um derivatives are a new way of
0:41
thinking about change because they apply
0:43
to instantaneous change not average
0:46
change like slopes in
0:48
algebra here in topic
Topic 2.2
0:50
2.2 we can see some common notations for
0:53
a
0:54
derivative right here and dydx is
0:59
sometimes helpful to use because it
1:01
makes the derivative stand out but
1:03
overall these are all interchangeable
1:06
notations so you also need to understand
1:09
how derivatives and tangent lines are
1:11
connected in case you forgot a tangent
1:13
line is defined as the line that
1:14
intersects the graph only once near the
1:16
tangent point the key connection is that
1:19
the slope of the tangent line always
1:21
equals the derivative of the function at
1:23
that
1:25
point which we will see on this graph
1:28
here let's get into into an example we
1:31
have a question that asks us to find the
1:34
tangent line to the graph y = x^2 x = 1
1:37
given that the derivative at that point
1:39
is two so to solve this question we have
1:42
to use point slope formula which you
1:45
might remember from algebra class but it
1:48
basically says it's a it's just a way of
1:51
solving a linear equations so y - y1
1:54
where y1 is the Y value equals m the
1:57
slope * x - X1 where X is the X value so
2:01
we plugged in x = 1 to solve for y1 and
2:04
y1 is actually 1 so and then X1 is
2:09
obviously xal 1 so X1 is 1 as well and
2:13
then based on what we just learned that
2:15
the slope of the tangent LS the
2:17
derivative we can replace M here the
2:19
slope with dydx the
2:22
derivative and then we know that the
2:25
derivative is two because it's given to
2:27
us so using the derivative here
2:30
and plugging in two we can solve for the
2:33
equation of the tangent
2:36
line topic 2.3 is about how you can
Topic 2.3
2:39
estimate derivatives without actually
2:41
knowing the function remember that a
2:43
derivative is kind of like a slope just
2:45
at two points instead of just at one
2:47
point instead of two but if we choose
2:49
two points that are pretty close to each
2:51
other the slope is going to approximate
2:53
the
2:53
derivative let's do that in this example
2:55
Problem by finding the slope between x =
2:58
3 and X = = 5 and using this to
3:01
approximate the derivative at x =
3:03
4 and keep in mind that we're using x =
3:06
3 and x = 5 because these are the
3:08
nearest points you always want to use
3:10
the closest points to find the estimate
3:13
of the
3:14
derivative so we just go through this
3:17
process um plugging these numbers into
3:20
the slope formula and we get two as our
3:23
approximation for the
3:25
derivative and one other thing to keep
3:27
in mind is that the slope between these
3:30
two closest points is called the slope
3:32
of the secant line not to be confused
3:35
with secant the trig function that's
3:37
completely under completely unrelated
3:40
and then the derivative is the slope of
3:42
the tangent
3:43
line you might see that um those terms
3:46
on a test or something like that so
3:49
topic
Topic 2.4
3:51
2.4 um is about how differentiability
3:54
and continuity are connected and
3:56
differentiability just means like
3:58
whether you can differentiate a
4:00
function so there are three kind of key
4:02
phrases to remember uh differentiability
4:05
implies
4:06
continuity a derivative cannot exist
4:09
where the function doesn't and then
4:11
continuity does not imply
4:14
differentiability so I like to think of
4:17
it as how a square is a rectangle but a
4:21
rectangle is not necessarily a
4:24
square so in both cases the square is
4:28
more specific than a rectangle Le and
4:30
then also being differentiable is more
4:32
specific than being continuous so just
4:35
because you have something that's
4:38
continuous doesn't mean that it has to
4:40
be
4:41
differentiable and there are two kind of
4:44
two main types of types of points where
4:48
you have a continuous function that's
4:50
not
4:51
differentiable so first of all on this
4:53
graph you have the absolute value
4:56
function and at zero there's like this
4:57
sharp changing Point that's called a
4:59
cusp
5:00
and so the derivative is not defined
5:02
right here and then the other the other
5:06
reason a function that's continuous
5:07
would not be differentiable is if there
5:09
was a vertical tangent line so on a
5:12
graph that was like growing growing
5:15
growing and then it just went straight
5:17
up for a second like right here um so
5:22
the derivative would kind of be like
5:24
Infinity if the derivative existed
5:27
because the function is just going
5:28
straight up so the derivative also
5:30
doesn't exist there even though it's
5:33
continuous topic 2.5 the power rule
Topic 2.5
5:36
introduces a helpful way for
5:38
differentiating polinomial the rule is
5:40
that when you take the derivative of a x
5:42
to the end term you bring the exponent
5:45
in front and then subtract one from the
5:48
exponent and keep it there on top of the
5:52
X so we have two examples here first of
5:56
all find the derivative of
5:58
x^2 so we we take the two and we put it
6:01
in front and then we subtract one from
6:03
the exponent to just get
6:06
2X and then a trickier example right
6:10
here is to differentiate this
6:12
polinomial so we just do the same thing
6:15
we take each derivative separately which
6:17
we'll actually talk more about in the
6:19
next topic but we take each exponent
6:22
bring it up
6:24
front and then we subtract one from each
6:27
exponent and also keep in mind that you
6:29
can't forget about these coefficients
6:31
right here the four 2 and the one so um
6:35
you have to make sure that you multipli
6:37
the coefficient by the
6:39
exponent now on to topic
Topic 2.6
6:42
2.6 this is mostly trivial stuff I mean
6:46
so it just says that the derivative of a
6:49
sum or a
6:50
scalar is the sum of the derivatives or
6:55
the scalar times the
6:57
derivative well so those are the second
6:59
and third points right here and then the
7:01
first point is that the derivative of
7:04
any constant like just a single number
7:07
is always
7:09
zero so these are helpful to keep in
7:12
mind but it I mean it's kind of obvious
7:16
but yeah so you have to understand these
7:18
properties and then topic
Topic 2.7
7:21
2.7 is an important topic as it shows
7:24
you how to take other derivatives like s
7:26
cosine e to X and Ln X
7:30
s and cosine derivatives are pretty easy
7:31
to remember because they actually turn
7:34
into each other when you differentiate
7:36
each of them but when you differentiate
7:39
cosine you have to tack on a negative
7:43
sign so sign turns into cosine cosine
7:46
turns into s but cosine you have to tack
7:49
on this negative sign so cosine turns
7:51
into negative
7:53
sign and
7:55
then the derivative of e to X is really
7:58
special because it's just itself e to
8:01
X and more broadly speaking the
8:04
derivative of an exponential with any
8:06
base a x is a X plus this I mean times
8:10
the
8:12
LNA so logs are also kind of similar
8:16
there's the special case where you have
8:17
the natural log of x and it's just 1 /x
8:22
but then when you take the derivative of
8:24
any log base of X you just get one /x
8:28
and then you also have to tag on this
8:30
lnb to take care of the different
8:35
base so topic 2.8 is another important
Topic 2.8
8:38
rule the product rule because it helps
8:40
you differentiate the product of two
8:43
functions basically you take the
8:45
derivative of the first one F Prime
8:48
multiply by the second one G and then
8:51
add the first one times the derivative
8:53
of the second one G Prime of
8:57
X for example let's take the derivative
8:59
of X Cub * sin x we just work through
9:03
the
9:03
formula so we take the derivative of the
9:06
first one X cubed and we get
9:09
3x^2 we multiply by the second one sinx
9:12
and then we add the first one X cubed
9:15
times the derivative of the second one
9:18
sin x which turns into cosine X and so
9:21
this kind of shows how the other
9:22
derivative rules are
9:24
also um they're really all kind of
9:27
intertwined because you use them uh in
9:30
tandem a lot of the
9:33
time now topic 2.9 the quotient rule
Topic 2.9
9:36
tells you how to differentiate the
9:38
quotient of two
9:40
functions and the formula right here
9:43
might look kind of
9:45
complicated but I have a simple way of
9:47
remembering it so I take the high
9:50
function the I mean the numerator and
9:53
call it high and the denominator and
9:55
call it low and then I just say low D
10:00
High minus high D low all over low 2 is
10:03
the derivative so again that's low D
10:06
High minus high D low over low
10:08
s you can kind of uh use that saying to
10:11
help you remember this formula but
10:13
anyways let's go into an example
10:15
differentiate f ofx is sin x over
10:19
x^2 so we take low x^2 * D High the
10:24
derivative of s again is
10:26
cosine and subtract High sin x * D and
10:32
the derivative of x^2 using the power
10:34
rule is 2x so that gets us the numerator
10:38
and then we do that all over low s and
10:41
x^2 2 is just X
10:44
4th and then another example here we
10:48
have to differentiate this um X Cub -
10:51
2x^2 X and when you see this you might
10:54
be tempted to just plug in the quotient
10:57
rule right away and solve but you
10:59
actually don't need to because you can
11:01
divide each term here by X and that
11:04
makes the derivative a lot easier
11:07
because it just turns into a polom that
11:09
you can use the power rule to
11:12
solve so whenever you're about to use
11:14
the quotient rule just kind of pause for
11:16
a second and see if there's an easy way
11:17
to simplify it into a derivative that's
11:20
a little bit
11:23
easier the final topic is topic 2.10
Topic 2.10
11:27
which tells you how to differentiate all
11:28
the other
11:29
functions instead of memorizing all the
11:32
derivatives which are shown right here
11:33
by the way you can set up this
11:36
diagram and then use our special trick
11:40
that we
11:42
have so what you do when you want to
11:44
find the derivative of secant tangent
11:48
cosecant or
11:49
cotangent is you so let's divide this
11:53
diagram into three parts there are the
11:56
edges and then the middle part so you
12:00
find on either Edge the function you're
12:02
trying to differentiate so let's say
12:05
secant so you don't use you never start
12:08
off with the middle part of this diagram
12:09
you always start on the ends so if you
12:12
want to differentiate secant we start
12:14
right here see X and then what you do is
12:18
you go across the row in the opposite
12:20
direction so the derivative of secant is
12:24
secant times tangent and then let's
12:28
check the table and yes derivative of
12:30
secant is secant time tangent and then
12:33
if you're on the bottom row here let's
12:35
say you want to differentiate cotangent
12:37
you just go across the row in the
12:39
opposite direction so derivative of
12:40
cotangent is negative cosecant *
12:46
cosecant so um you have to either you
12:49
can either just write down this diagram
12:51
and then use it pretty easily you can
12:54
also you can write this diagram down on
12:55
your tests and then you don't have to
12:57
remember any of them anyways cuz you can
12:59
just use the diagram or you can just
13:01
memorize all of the trig derivatives
13:03
which is a little more tedious but
13:05
whatever works for
13:07
you so that's the last topic and we are
13:10
now done with unit two of AP calculus"""
